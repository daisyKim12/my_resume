        "body": "I am Sukjin Kim, a second-semester graduate student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Seoul National University. My research interests include accelerating AI models using multi-GPU systems and optimizing models with CXL and AI accelerators. I primarily focus on optimizing single-GPU kernels using CUDA and apply this expertise to the field of approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search in vector databases to efficiently retrieve similar information. My research aims to integrate this into retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Additionally, I study scalable ANN methods using multi-GPU systems, and I have submitted a paper on multi-GPU scalable ANN, which is currently under review. I am also researching scalable solutions for vector database search using memory expanders like CXL and exploring ways to accelerate this process further by utilizing near-memory processors on CXL devices."
